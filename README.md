<b>Single Page Application Term Project from Web Applications Development Course</b>

Project entailed creating a file upload single page application (once page is interacted with, the content automatically changes/refreshes) using asynchronous javascript and xml (ajax)

I made my project plant themed where the user can upload a plant into their garden. The plant file will then be stored in the server and the plant index, fileaname, and user description will then be stored in a MariaDB database.
